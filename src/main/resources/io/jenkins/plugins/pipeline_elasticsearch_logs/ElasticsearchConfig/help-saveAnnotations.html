  Save information about annotations that were present in the message in the events sent to Elasticsearch.<br/>
  Annotations allow Jenkins to generate links in the logs, dynamically apply formatting and do other things.
  Enable this option when you want to display the logs in Jenkins itself.  
  When the logs are only displayed with external viewers the annotations are usually not required.

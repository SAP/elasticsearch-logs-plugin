  A truststore with a SSL certificate used to validate the certificate of the Elasticsearch server when using https.<br/>
  In case you have a fitting certificate in the truststore of your JVM running Jenkins you can leave this empty.<br/>
  When you provide an own truststore the default certificates of the JVM are ignored.

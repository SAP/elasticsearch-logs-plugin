Configuration of the plugin may change without further notice in an incompatible way!

### Description

A Jenkins plugin to send Pipeline build logs to an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) instance.

This is an [implementation of JEP-210](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/210/README.adoc).


### Requirements

 - [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
 - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)

### Download and Installation

In your Jenkins go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available** check **Pipeline Logging via Elastic Search** and press **Install without restart**

### Configuration

Go to **Manage Jenkins > System Configuration > Logging to Elasticsearch for Pipelines** and select **Enable**.

### Limitations

Currently the plugin is only able to push the logs to Elasticsearch but the way back to read the logs from ElasticSearch and display in Jenkins is not yet implemented.
The initial scope of this plugin was to use it it in a [JenkinsFileRunner](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner) scenario.

#### Code Style

The [Jenkins Beginners Guide to Contribute](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing#BeginnersGuidetoContributing-CodeStyle) recommends the [Oracle Code Conventions for Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html) from 1999.

Those [Guidelines](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Code+Style+Guidelines) however might better describe the Code Style rules we apply.
